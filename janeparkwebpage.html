<h2>Bio</h2>

<blockquote>Hi there, thanks for visiting my page. My name is Jane Park. These are some of my favorite things: Comedy, Cooking and Coding. If you abbreviate that, it would be CCC, which can also mean Chocolate Chip Cookies -- which I also love! Follow me on my ever changing path that lead me to where I am. Happy Coding! </blockquote>
